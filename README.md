## Introduction
Welcome to `biar`! üëã

Think of it as your all-in-one solution for smoother async requests development.

ü§ì while working on different tech companies I found myself using the same stack of 
Python libraries over and over. In each new project I'd add same requirements and create
Python clients sharing a lot of code I've already developed before.

That's why in `biar` I've packed the functionality of some top-notch Python projects:

- **[aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)**: for lightning-fast HTTP requests in async Python.
- **[tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity)**: ensures your code doesn't give up easily, allowing retries for 
better resilience.
- **[pyrate-limiter](https://github.com/vutran1710/PyrateLimiter)**: manage rate limits effectively, async ready.
- **[yarl](https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl)**: simplifies handling and manipulating URLs.
- **[pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic)**: helps validate and manage data structures with ease.
- **[loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)**: your ultimate logging companion, making logs a breeze.

With `biar`, you get all these awesome tools rolled into one package, all within a 
unified API. It's the shortcut to handling async requests, retries, rate limits, data 
validation, URL manipulation, Proxy and logging‚Äîall in a straightforward tool.

Give `biar` a spin and see how it streamlines your async request development!

## Examples


### With `biar` vs without
Imagine a scenario where you need to make several requests to an API. But not only that,
you also need to handle rate limits, retries, and logging.

Imagine you need to make 10 requests to an API. The API has a rate limit of 5 requests
per second. The API is not very stable, so could set up a retry each request up to 5 
times. The rate limit is 5 requests per second. You need to log each request and its
response.

We can use aioresponses to mock the server and simulate the scenario. Check the
example below:

```python
import asyncio

from aioresponses import aioresponses
from pydantic import BaseModel
from yarl import URL

BASE_URL = URL("https://api.com/v1/entity/")


class MyModel(BaseModel):
    id_entity: str
    feature: int


async def main():
    with aioresponses() as mock_server:
        # set up mock server
        request_urls = []
        for i in range(10):
            url = BASE_URL / str(i)

            # 500 error on first request for each url
            mock_server.get(url=url, status=500)

            # 200 success
            response_json = {"id_entity": str(i), "feature": 123}
            mock_server.get(url=url, payload=response_json, status=200)
            request_urls.append(url)

        # act
        results = await make_requests(request_urls=request_urls)
        print(f"Structured content:\n{results}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())

```

Without `biar`, you probably would implement the `make_requests` function like this:


```python
from typing import List

import aiohttp
from pyrate_limiter import Duration, InMemoryBucket, Limiter, Rate
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
from yarl import URL


async def fetch_data(
    session: aiohttp.ClientSession, url: URL, limiter: Limiter
) -> MyModel:
    limiter.try_acquire(name="my_api")
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        if response.status == 500:
            raise Exception("Server Error")
        response_json = await response.json()
        return MyModel(**response_json)


@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(5), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=0, max=10))
async def fetch_with_retry(
    session: aiohttp.ClientSession, url: URL, limiter: Limiter
) -> MyModel:
    return await fetch_data(session=session, url=url, limiter=limiter)


async def make_requests(request_urls: List[URL]) -> List[MyModel]:
    limiter = Limiter(
        InMemoryBucket(rates=[Rate(5, Duration.SECOND)]),
        raise_when_fail=False,
        max_delay=Duration.MINUTE.value,
    )
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = []
        for url in request_urls:
            task = fetch_with_retry(session=session, url=url, limiter=limiter)
            tasks.append(task)
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return results
```

Using the right tools is not terrible right? But depend on importing several things and
knowing how to use these libraries. There's a lot of concepts to understand here like
context managers, decorators, async, etc. Additionally, this is obviously not the only 
way to do it. Without a standard way to handle these requests, you'll probably end up 
with a lot of boilerplate code, and different developers will implement it in different
ways.

With `biar`, you can implement the same `make_requests` function like this:

```python
from typing import List

from yarl import URL
import biar

async def make_requests(request_urls: List[URL]) -> List[MyModel]:
    responses = await biar.request_structured_many(
        model=MyModel,
        urls=request_urls,
        config=biar.RequestConfig(
            method="GET",
            retryer=biar.Retryer(attempts=5, min_delay=0, max_delay=10),
            rate_limiter=biar.RateLimiter(rate=5, time_frame=1),
        )
    )
    return [response.structured_content for response in responses]
```

Easy, right? ‚ú®üç∞

You also automatically get a nice log:

```

### Post request with structured payload
You don't  need to deal with json serialization. You can make post requests passing a 
payload as a `pydantic` model. Check the example below:

```python
import asyncio
import datetime

from aioresponses import CallbackResult, aioresponses
from pydantic import BaseModel
from yarl import URL

import biar

BASE_URL = URL("https://api.com/v1/entity/")


class Payload(BaseModel):
    id: str
    ts: datetime.datetime
    feature: int


async def main():
    with aioresponses() as mock_server:
        # set up mock server
        def callback(_, **kwargs):
            json_payload = kwargs.get("json")
            print(f"Received payload: {json_payload}")
            return CallbackResult(status=200)

        mock_server.post(url=BASE_URL / "id", status=200, callback=callback)

        # act
        _ = await biar.request(
            url=BASE_URL / "id",
            config=biar.RequestConfig(method="POST"),
            payload=Payload(id="id", ts=datetime.datetime.now(), feature=123),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())

```

Output:
```
2023-11-23 01:14:33.839 | DEBUG    | biar.services:request:113 - Request started, POST method to https://api.com/v1/entity/id...
2023-11-23 01:14:33.840 | DEBUG    | biar.services:request:159 - Request finished!
Received payload: {'id': 'id', 'ts': '2023-11-23T01:15:43.883492', 'feature': 123}
```
