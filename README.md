## Introduction
Welcome to `biar`! ðŸ‘‹

Think of it as your all-in-one solution for smoother async requests development.

ðŸ¤“ while working on different tech companies I found myself using the same stack of Python libraries over and over. In each new project I'd add same requirements and create Python clients sharing a lot of code I've already developed before.

That's why in `biar` I've packed the functionality of some top-notch Python projects:

- **[aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)**: for lightning-fast HTTP requests in async Python.
- **[tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity)**: ensures your code doesn't give up easily, allowing retries for better resilience.
- **[pyrate-limiter](https://github.com/vutran1710/PyrateLimiter)**: manage your application's rate limits effectively.
- **[yarl](https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl)**: simplifies handling and manipulating URLs in async applications.
- **[pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic)**: helps validate and manage data structures with ease.
- **[loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)**: your ultimate logging companion, making logs a breeze.

With `biar`, you get all these awesome tools rolled into one package, all within a unified API. It's the shortcut to handling async requests, retries, rate limits, data validation, URL manipulation, Proxy and loggingâ€”all in a straightforward tool.

Give `biar` a spin and see how it streamlines your async request development!
